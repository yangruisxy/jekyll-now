title: A Simple Ray Tracer
---

Here is a blog talking about my simple ray tracer for the cmpm265's final project. My ray tracer was built in C++ programming languages. It mainly contains the following features. 
The first image is simply a triangle. It shows that my ray tracer could handle ray-triangle intersection correctly. 
The solution of ray -triangle intersection can be founded in Tomas MÃ¶ller's paper.

Here is a image generated by my ray tracer by following Peter Shirley's amazing book. You can see it has checker textures, a lots of spheres with 3 different materials: lambertian, mental and dielectric. Also motion blur is added into the scene as a bonus feature.

Here is image showing the texture mapping feature of my ray tracer. This image is showing that I project a earthmap like this
![Earthmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/earthmap.jpg)
into a sphere, which gives us a earth.

This image is showing procedural generated textures are added onto two spheres by using Perlin noise algorithm.

This image is showing a cornell box image generated by my ray tracer with instancing features, such as rotation, translation and scale.

This image is also a cornell box, but noting that the material of the box and and the cube are changing into volume materials such as fog.

This image is showing the cornell box with dielectric spheres.

Limitations.
As you can see from the the two images, there are many noises in my image comparing with Jensen'image. Those noises are mainly because there are lot of rays cannot sample the light source's energy in their whole life.

Further Work.
In the future, I would like to add Bounding Volume Hierarchies into my ray tracer, then I will take a look at Monte Carlo Integration and C++ Parallel Programming.
Fliud simulation is also what I'm trying to achieve in the future for my project.
