title: A Simple Ray Tracer
---

Here is a blog talking about my simple ray tracer for the cmpm265's final project. My ray tracer was built in C++ programming languages. It mainly contains the following features. 
The first image is simply a triangle. It shows that my ray tracer could handle ray-triangle intersection correctly. 
The solution of ray -triangle intersection can be founded in Tomas MÃ¶ller's paper.

Here is a image generated by my ray tracer by following Peter Shirley's amazing book. You can see it has checker textures, a lots of spheres with 3 different materials: lambertian, mental and dielectric. Also motion blur is added into the scene as a bonus feature.

Here is image showing the texture mapping feature of my ray tracer. This image is showing that I project a earthmap like this
![Earthmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/earthmap.jpg)
into a sphere, which gives us a earth.
